///////////
///TCPIP protocol
//a protocol is a set of rules that two sides agree on to use when communicating
// how do a client and server identify each other
//each has a ip, they open a socket(a passage between the two devices)
//the request and respond has to follow a protocol, (http/ftp/smtp)
//the way that information is sent is TCP 
//the act of splitting a (information) message into pieces(packets) and sending it through the socket is TCP
//the os, has this ability, and node gives us access to use them
//TCP is the same concept as a stream, and node treats these packets as a stream
//we open and close sockets frequently. web sockets stay opened so that we can exchange data through the server at all time

///////////////////////////////
//how information gets to node process (address and ports)
//port, once a computer receives a packet, how it knows what program to send it to
//when a program is setup on the operating system to receive packets from a port, it's said that it's listening to that port

///////how is information is structured  using http
//http is a set of rules for the data being transferred on the web
///status(200 ok,300,400,500), headers(name value pairs)(body)
//mime type a standard for specifying the type of information being sent
//it's programmed to behave differently to each type (application/json,text/html,image/jpeg)

//////http_parser
//it's a standalone program that's part of nodejs
//it extracts information from the http request and returns them
//

//////creating a web server in node
const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');

    //when the server emits, this will be the function that runs
    res.writeHead(200, {

    });
    //sending myfile a chunk at a time, piping it to the response
    if (req.url === '/')
        fs.createReadStream(myPath, {
            encoding: 'utf8'
        }).pipe(res);

///apis and endpoints 

//api is a set of tool for building a software application,
//web api is a set of url which accepts and sends only data via http and tcp/ip

//a url in a web api is an endpoint

//mapping http requests to content
