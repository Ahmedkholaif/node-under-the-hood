//////////////processors, machine code, c++
/**
 * mircroprocessor is a tiny machine that we give instructions
 * they don't all speak the same language some speak (instructions) x86-64 arm mips ia-32
 * we write code in high level languages that has to be turned into (compiled) machine code
 * machine code ==> assembly language ==> c/c++ ==> javascript
 * high freedom with the memory and processor ==========>very high abstraction
 * node is written in c++
 * v8 is written in c++ 
 * v8 is a chrome engine that compiles javascript code (converts it into machine code)
 * 
 * javascript engines and ecmascript specification 
 * ecmascript is the standard javascript is based on (we needed it because of the many engines)
 * 
 * javascript engine is an engine that follows ecmascript standard that compiles javascript into machine code
 * v8 is open source engine from google
 * 
 * adding features to javascript 
 * add these to your v8 engine that runs on your machine 
 * javascript code ====> V8 ======> machine code
 * javascript code ====> my program that have V8 ====> machine code
 * 
 * that's how node was built, it allowed javasciprt to read and write files because it calls c++ code
